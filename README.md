# C Programming Practice Tasks

This repository contains beginner-level C programming tasks.  
Each section in [`src/tasks.c`](src/tasks.c) corresponds to a different exercise, including:

- Declaring and initializing variables
- Printing messages
- Taking input (integer, float, character)
- Practicing formatted output



## 🚀 How to Run
Compile and run the program using GCC:

```bash
cd src
gcc tasks.c -o tasks
./tasks


⚠️ Note: Only one task should be uncommented at a time when testing.
